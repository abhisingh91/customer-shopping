# customer-shopping
<br>
This tableau project shows insights/visualizations on "customer-shopping-data"
<br>

### The project is divided into four sections <br>
1. **Overview** <br>
  It displays a concise overview of the dataset. <br>

2. **Shopping Mall Analysis** <br>
  Get insights into which malls had the most engagement.

3. **Shopping Demographics** <br>
  Shows the gender and age-wise shopping analysis. <br>
  
   This section also contains two filter sheets:
   - Gender - Select a specific gender bar from the Gender Distribution sheet
   - Age - Select specific Age(bin) from Age Distribution sheet <br><br>
   > **Note**: These filters will affect the visuals across all the sheets. <br>
               &emsp;&emsp; Not all sheets may look meaningful after applying the filters. <br>
               &emsp;&emsp; So, focus only on the ones that do.

4. **Product Sales Analysis** <br>
   Insights related to the categories of the products that were sold across the malls.

The last Container contains two sheets:
- **Purchase Pattern Over Time** - Shows the sales of products over time <br>
I have also added a separate filter box for this sheet just because you have to scroll too much to apply the above two filters.
- **Payment Method Distribution**
<br>
‚ú® I hope you find this useful <br>
ü§ù Also, I am open to any suggestions or changes to improve the workbook

### **Thank You**
